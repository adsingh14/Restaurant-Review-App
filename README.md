# _Restaurant Reviews App_
---

## Project Overview:

**Restaurant Reviews** is an app for getting know about the restaurants from different places. Also, your previous viewed restaurants will not lost the data without your consent, which offers you a seamless offline experience.
This app is also supported Accessibility features.


### How to run it on local ?

1. Clone this repo, `git clone https://github.com/adsingh14/Restaurant-Review-App.git`

2. Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the link: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
